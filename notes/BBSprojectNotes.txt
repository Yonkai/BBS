☠️✅🤔👀
"Layers" for my simple BBS application, all information may be wrong or poorly understood, beware:

✅0. Tear down the current application representation (as on 2/5/2019)
and start from a new tag on github, using instead the react and nextjs framework
as it fits better, IMO, with the native directory structure
of nextjs and forums in general, as shown in the wikipedia article. 

🤔0.5? Add Redux maybe for educational purposes, however I don't think the scale of this
application will genuinely warrant it. Same applies to an error reporting service
like sentry or a content integration system like Travis CI.
(Do last.)

✅1. Begin with a FRONTEND basic html/jsx that represents a bare minimum 
representation of all interfaces that will be needed for the final
application, including content locked html pages, i.e. admin access
and moderation panels. There will be no content restriction on this
version. Pages will exist without restriction. Use composition. 
(Moderation will require backend work w/Auth.)


1.5 Design MySQL Schema in MySQL Workbench.

2. For backend now, using an ORM (Sequelize?) with MySQL and express middlewares, create connections to the express or node web server
from the nextjs part of the application, and from the express web server to the MySQL DigitalOcean database server, and any other transverals
as need, conceptually in MVC style:

NextJS-> View
Express/Node-> Controller
MySQL-> Model

Make sure to sanitize, normalize, and limit throughput. 
There is intent for the database to be a buffer only holding a certain amount of space at once (images/text).

Make physical flow diagrams to internalize these processes better, better yet, do that for the whole application. 

4. Write tests with Jest or whatever else.

5. Make a production version of the application, making changes as needed.

6. Add SASS/CSS/UI refinements: Media queries, styling, etc.

7. Update HTTP headers for better DNS caching.

8. Host a live version on an ubuntu/nginx server on my DigitalOcean cloud account.

8.5 Do an OWASP Top 10 review to hit top security issues.

9. Done?

10. Post online for review, refine more, etc.

Current Stack: 
NextJS 
Css-Grid 

Note on rd:Do mobile first, then scale up.
